> ### Describe the process that takes place when you initiate a search on google in terms of what we discussed.
>> Essentially, after being connected to the internet via a router and my ISP, I have used my web browser to open up Google's 'search engine' website at their domain 'google.com' (an alias for whatever IP address they are using).  When I type in a request string and submit the form, an HTTP request is sent to the appropriate server, and it returns an HTTP response containing the results of my query.  These results are listed on an html webpage that my browser interprets, and contains many hyperlinks to additional websites that are hosted on different servers across the world.  There is far more nuance here, but this expresses the basic premise.
